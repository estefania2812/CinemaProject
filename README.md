University project:
Design and development of a database application for a cinema using PL/SQL environment and C# language (Winforms for the GUI).
We have 5 entities in the database: Movies, Clients, Rooms, Tickets, Reservations and Screens (date, time and room for each movie). Through this app we can add, update, delete or just see the existing data among other functions.
